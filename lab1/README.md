# Quadratic Equation Solver

Common appliaction that allow user to solve and recieve roots of quadratic equation.
For developing used *C#* programming language and .NET Core.

Prepared for [*first lab*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pTz_GAy3GX0GxxoRV5DAiCIGJyMOONHuT9WQS8JgrB0/edit#)

## What is Quadratic Equation?

A quadratic equation is an algebraic expression of the second degree in x. 
The quadratic equation in its standard form is ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b are the coefficients, x is the variable, and c is the constant term. 

## Installation and using

1. Install .NET.

2. Clone repository
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/gapiyka/MandT-of-soft-dev
```
3. Compile project or [*C#* file](https://github.com/gapiyka/MandT-of-soft-dev/blob/main/lab1/Program.cs)

4. Launch application:
 - Interective mode:
	- Run app
	```bash
	  C:\repo-path\MandT-of-soft-dev\lab1\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\lab1.exe
	``` 
	- Input a,b and c argument.
	
	
- Non-Interective mode (by file):
	- Create *.txt* file with 3 arguments splited by space.
	- Run app with input argument **path to file** 
	```bash
	  C:\repo-path\MandT-of-soft-dev\lab1\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\lab1.exe C:\repo-path\MandT-of-soft-dev\lab1\args.txt
	``` 
	
- Non-Interective mode (by file):
	- Run app with input 3 arguments **a b c** 
	```bash
	  C:\repo-path\MandT-of-soft-dev\lab1\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\lab1.exe 2 4 2
	```
