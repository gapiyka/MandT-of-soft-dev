# Double Linked List

Common appliaction that show realization double linked list without using implemented libraries.
For developing used *C#* programming language and .NET Core.

Prepared for [*second lab*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SRRPKRRHw2gRPdYLC3ENGgVIKVMpeZ3eCzFd9bkrSEA/edit#)

## What is Linked List?

Doubly linked list is a complex type of linked list in which a node contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node in the sequence. 
Therefore, in a doubly linked list, a node consists of three parts: node data, pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer) , pointer to the previous node (previous pointer). 
A sample node in a doubly linked list is shown in the figure.
